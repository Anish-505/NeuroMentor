# NeuroMentor
NeuroMentor is an EEG-based stress monitoring and neurofeedback system designed to analyze brain activity and estimate mental stress levels in real time. The project focuses on acquiring non-invasive EEG signals, processing them using digital signal processing techniques, and interpreting neural patterns associated with stress and cognitive load.
